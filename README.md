# IntrotoCS
Projects made in Python3 to teach students fundamentals of computer science when I was a Course Assistant for an Intro to CS course. 

Projects were split into 2 types: Assignments and Labs for students to complete. These files are my implementations of each project.
Below is a list of descriptions of each project:

Assignments:

cs115.py - Module that provides range, map, filter, and reduce functions in Python 2.7 style for use with Python 3. Module required for some files

operations.py - Implementation of basic operations such as factorial, mean, and primes

scrabblescores.py - Recursive implementation of creating words and their score based on a list of words as a dictionary

scrabblescores2&change.py - Recursive implementation of the smallest change problem and new scrabblescores function as well as tail recursive functions on lists

pascal_triangle.py - Recurisve implementation of pascal's triangle

memoization.py - Recursive implementation of Lucas numbers sequence and change problem using memoization as well as implementing a function that uses turtle graphics to draw a tree

runlength_encoding.py - Recursive implementation of compressing/uncompressing bitstrings into/from their run-length encoding format

base_converter.py - Contains a function that can convert a number in any base to another base and two other functions that can add binary strings 

runlengthplus.py - Recursive implementation of compressing/uncompressing binary strings using adaptive run-length encoding.

iteration.py - Iterative implementations of operations on lists and scarabblescores

musicrecplus.py - Program that creates stores users and their favorite artists in a .txt file and uses collaborative filtering to give other users suggestions based on the information in the .txt file

nim.py - Implementation of a game of nim against the computer where the computer uses bitwise operations to play optimally

date.py - Implementation of a date class that stores and maniupulates dates

connect4.py - Object oriented implementation of a game of connect 4 between two players
